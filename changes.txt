== Changelog

Version 1.0001c
Backup date: 2011-09-20
Removed the Agent class and DWAGEON brain (unused anyway). Made headless compile (IMMUNEBOTS_NOGL preprocessor directive). Allow different types of boundary behavious (wrap, bounce, etc).
Allow "mass action" infection of susceptible cells (i.e. pick a cell at random to infect). Added Events to the setup file (i.e. when infected cells reach 1000, then add 50 CTL at random locations to the grid). Added simulation end conditions to the setup file, e.g. no infected cells left, or when infected cells reach a certain threshold. Moved drawing code from main loop (in GLView) to classes (Cell, CTl, Virion). More informative information on start up.

Version 1.0001b
Backup date: 2011-09-09
Cells have states now; setup object passed to every agent; add a 'stats' menu in the GUI; more robust and extensive initialisation from setup files and default rates in the code; better cell placement on the 2D grid and improved (non-)susceptibility code for targets; lots of supporting stats code added.

Version 1.0001a
Backup date: 2011-08-29
Minor changes - bug fixes, scantime added, better agent management and drawing code.

Version 1.0001
Backup date: 2011-08-26
Added serialisation code (using Boost archive). More command line options, including "no draw" (-d), allow simulation to start automatically (-a "automatic run"), set run ID (-i IDNUMBER).

Version 1.0
Backup date: 2011-04-28
Started to modularise the code - added AbstractAgent class as a template for all Agents (stationary or mobile).
Immunebots now requires AntTweakBar for the GUI.

Version 0.9
Backup date: 2011-04-08
Earliest backup I have of the immunebots source code.
