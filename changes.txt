== Changelog

Version 1.0007
Backup date: 2011-12-02
Added new Event ('Event AddWhen 10CTL@100Infected' => "Add 10 CTL When Infected == 100"). Rewrote the update stats and write_report code. Added new Event ('Event EndAfter 10Infected@100Infected' => "End when Infected count reaches 10 from 100"). Now quits with error if trying to place more cells than the world defaults permit. New End Condition ('Event End 3d@1000Infected' => "End 3 days after Infected count reached 1000"). CTL now log how much time they spend in each state (move, scan, lyse) if stats_extra is enabled. Minor corrections to the CTL code.

Version 1.0004
Backup date: 2011-10-25
Addition of the EventsList, i.e. adding of CTL at ratio E:T at a future time (as mentioned in v1.0001c). Random seed taken from /dev/urandom (linux only) instead of time(0).

Version 1.0002
Backup date: 2011-10-05
Added IMMUNEBOTS_NOSERIALISATION preprocessor directive to make Boost Archive optional. CTL check at 9 locations (center, and then 8 points on their border) for cells to scan. Improved checking if a CTL is on top of a cell (with the 'cellshadow' system). New Stats keyword for setup files to output gross numbers of agent numbers at regular intervals.

Version 1.0001c
Backup date: 2011-09-20
Removed the Agent class and DWAGEON brain (unused anyway). Made headless compile (IMMUNEBOTS_NOGL preprocessor directive). Allow different types of boundary behavious (wrap, bounce, etc).
Allow "mass action" infection of susceptible cells (i.e. pick a cell at random to infect). Added Events to the setup file (i.e. when infected cells reach 1000, then add 50 CTL at random locations to the grid). Added simulation end conditions to the setup file, e.g. no infected cells left, or when infected cells reach a certain threshold. Moved drawing code from main loop (in GLView) to classes (Cell, CTl, Virion). More informative information on start up.

Version 1.0001b
Backup date: 2011-09-09
Cells have states now; setup object passed to every agent; add a 'stats' menu in the GUI; more robust and extensive initialisation from setup files and default rates in the code; better cell placement on the 2D grid and improved (non-)susceptibility code for targets; lots of supporting stats code added.

Version 1.0001a
Backup date: 2011-08-29
Minor changes - bug fixes, scantime added, better agent management and drawing code.

Version 1.0001
Backup date: 2011-08-26
Added serialisation code (using Boost archive). More command line options, including "no draw" (-d), allow simulation to start automatically (-a "automatic run"), set run ID (-i IDNUMBER).

Version 1.0
Backup date: 2011-04-28
Started to modularise the code - added AbstractAgent class as a template for all Agents (stationary or mobile).
Immunebots now requires AntTweakBar for the GUI.

Version 0.9
Backup date: 2011-04-08
Earliest backup I have of the immunebots source code.
