# Simulation variables
# Possible variables:
## - RunID <runid>: May be overriden on the command line.
## - EndTime <seconds>: Time at which to end the simulation.
##     Note: simulation will also end if there are no more agents and may be overriden on the command line.
## - LayoutFile <filename>: should contain patch data, may contain non-susceptible cells, may contain
## - PlaceCells {true,false}: if true will wipe any existing cells (incl. CTL?) from the layout and replace them with non-susceptible cells.

# Edge-handing [BOX,BOUNDARY] for the movement-capable agents, e.g. CTL and Virions.
# Format: Agent	 {BOX,BOUNDARY}  <mode>
# EDGES: The agents can hit the BOX (area surrounding the susceptible/non-susceptible cells) or the BOUNDARY (hard boundary which defines the simulation).
# MODES: die (or become inactive), bounce off, wrap round (as if on a torus) or continue.
# Note: any action on the BOX edge other than 'continue' will prevent the agent from reaching the BOUNDARY.
# Note: continue is not a valid argument for the BOUNDARY edge.

# EventsQueue
# NB. NOT IMPLEMENTED (YET)
## This is to simulate the influx of new agents at a given time.
## Currently cannot add cells/agents with a different set of parms to any set previously.
## Format:  EVENT  add  <number>*<agent>@<time>
## Example: EVENT  add  1000*CD4@7d 	// Will add 1000 CD4 cells at day 7 (CD4 cells are Susceptible cells which move)
## Note: In the above example, "agent" does not refer directly to the Agent type, but to the event type (to allow for additional flexibility)
##   i.e. "CD4" is the event name to add movement-capable Susceptible cells to the simulation.
